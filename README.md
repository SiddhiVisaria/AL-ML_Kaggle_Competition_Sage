# AL-ML_Kaggle_Competition_Sage
Competition of "Sage" company for AI/ML Internship Role

You are provided with emissions data for most countries over the years 2015-2021. This data has been assembled by hand. The goal is to explore which countries have emissions profiles similar to the United States over the 2015-2021 time period by considering two factors: their total CO2 emissions and their change in CO2 emissions. You will have to do some data cleaning, calculate the relevant metrics per-country, and then use those metrics to compare vs the US.
